# A simple OPENRNDR program
Here we show a very simple program written using OPENRNDR. 
 
 <video controls>
    <source src="media/what-is-001.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>
</video>
 
 
 ```kotlin
application {
    program {
        extend {
            drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.PINK)
            drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.WHITE
            drawer.circle(drawer.bounds.center, abs(cos(seconds)) * height * 0.5)
        }
