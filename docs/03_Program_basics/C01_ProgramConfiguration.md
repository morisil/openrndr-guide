 
 # Program Configuration
Starting your program with a custom configuration looks roughly like this. 
 
 ```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    configure {// -- settings go here
    }
    program {
        // -- one time set up code goes here
        extend {// -- drawing code goes here
        }
    }
}
``` 
 
 ## Window size
Setting the window size is done through the `width` and `height` properties. 
 
 ```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    configure {
        width = 640
        height = 480
    }
}
``` 
 
 ## Window position
The default value for `position` is `null` for which the default behaviour is to place the window at the center of the primary display 
 
 ```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    configure {
        position = IntVector2(100, 400)
    }
}
``` 
 
 ## Fullscreen window

Setting the window size is done through the `width` and `height` properties.
 
 
 ```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    configure {
        width = 1920
        height = 1080
        fullscreen = Fullscreen.SET_DISPLAY_MODE
    }
}
``` 
 
 or if no mode change is desired use `Fullscreen.CURRENT_DISPLAY_MODE` 
 
 ```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    configure {
        fullscreen = Fullscreen.CURRENT_DISPLAY_MODE
    }
}
``` 
 
 # Window Title 
 
 ```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    configure {
        title = "Lo and behold!"
    }
}
``` 
 
 # Window unfocus behaviour
Two window unfocus behaviours are available. In `NORMAL` behaviour the program continues running at full speed, in contrast the `THROTTLE` behaviour throttles the program to 10Hz. 
 
 ```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    configure {
        unfocusBehaviour = UnfocusBehaviour.THROTTLE
    }
}
```
