 
 # Clipboard

OPENRNDR programs can access the clipboard. Currently only text snippets can be read from and written to the clipboard.

##### Setting the clipboard content 
 
 ```kotlin
application {
    program {
        clipboard.contents = "this is the new clipboard content"
    }
}
``` 
 
 ##### Getting the clipboard content

Note that `clipboard.contents` is optional and its value can be `null`. The clipboard contents are reported `null` in case the clipboard contents are non-text or the clipboard is empty. 
 
 ```kotlin
application {
    program {
        clipboard.contents?.let {
            println("the clipboard contents: $it")
        }
    }
}
```
