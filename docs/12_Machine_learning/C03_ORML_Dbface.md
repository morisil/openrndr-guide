# orml-dbface

DBFace is a real-time, single-stage face detector with high accuracy. orml-dbface 
provides the model and interface for easy use.

## What can I do with it?
The model provided by orml-dbface allows for fast detection of faces in images. This enables applications
that can detect and locate faces.

For a more detailed face extraction and face pose estimation look for [orml-facemesh](../orml-facemesh/README.md)

## How do I use it?
First load the dbface model.

```kotlin
val dbface = DBFaceDetector.load()
```

Then for every frame.
```kotlin
val rectangles = dbface.detectFaces(videoFrame)
drawer.fill = null
drawer.stroke = ColorRGBa.PINK
for (r in rectangles) {
    drawer.rectangle(r.area * Vector2(640.0, 480.0))
    for (l in r.landmarks) {
        drawer.circle(l.x * 640.0, l.y * 480.0, 10.0)
    }
}
```
