# orml-super-resolution

Image up-scaling based on FALSR super resolution neural network

## What can I do with it?

`orml-super-resolution` can be used to up-scale images. The FALSR network usually
generates sharper images than bilinear upscaling.

## How do I use it?

To load the up-scaler:
```kotlin
val upscaler = ImageUpscaler.load()
```

To upscale a single image:

```kotlin
val image = loadImage("<some-image>")
val upscaled = upscaler.upscale(image)
```

[DemoUpscale.kt](https://github.com/openrndr/orml/blob/orml-0.3/orml-super-resolution/src/demo/kotlin/DemoUpscale.kt) demonstrates the full process of upscaling images.

## Credits and references

`orml-super-resolution` uses a pretrained network from https://github.com/xiaomi-automl/FALSR, to be exact it uses the FALSR-A variant.
